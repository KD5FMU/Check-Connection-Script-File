# check-connection
This is a script file for ASL 3 to check for a specific node connection and if it is not present the server will re-connect to it.

As I have said before, I like to put all of my script files in the /etc/asterisk/local folder, But ASL3 does not come with that folder by default so you can create the directory by running this command:

```
sudo mkdir /etc/asterisk/local
```


To get the script file downloaded onto your node just use this command:
```

```
